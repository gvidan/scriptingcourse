Week 1: Debugging exercise 2. Debugging List Operations 

Each one of these exercises requires you to alter the code in some way. 
If the code works properly then it will run up until that point and then stop.

Each exercise should require only one kind of change/alteration.

#1. Create a list
list1 = ["1","2","3","4","5"]

#2. Create a second list
list2 = ["6","7","8","9","10"]

#3. Concatenate two lists
list3 = list1 + list2

#4. Iterate through a list
for i in list3:
	print i
	
#5. Iterate through a list by assignment
for i in range(len(list3)):
	print list3[i]
	
#6. Replace one list element with another
list1[0] = list2[-1]


#7. Adding one element to a list
list1 = list1 + ["new element"]

#8. Operating on a list: 
oldList = [1,4,3,2,6]
newList = [ str(x) for x in oldList]
