Example 4: Method Manipulation

# Week 1: Example Code 4: Methods

Python is an "object-oriented" language. 
This means that we work with objects, with their own properties and methods.

A method is a systematic technique for acting upon an object. 
Methods can exist by themselves or inside of a "class".
We will discuss classes and objects in a later tutorial.
